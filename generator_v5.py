#  Version 5
# Explanation:
# Damping Factor: The generate_weighted_random_number function now includes a damping factor to reduce the influence of frequently drawn numbers. This means even less frequent numbers have a fair chance of being selected.
# Random Selection of Common Sets: Instead of always using common pairs, triplets, or quads, this method randomly selects one or more from these sets, ensuring they donâ€™t dominate the generated numbers.
# Balanced Influence: The overall approach introduces enough randomness to prevent the generated numbers from being overly biased towards historical patterns.
# Weights: By assigning different weights, the algorithm prioritizes the most common pairs, followed by consecutive pairs, triplets, and so forth. This way, the rarer combinations like triplets and quads have a lower influence, aligning with your preferences.
# Randomness: Despite the weights, the algorithm retains a level of randomness, ensuring that the generated numbers are not overly predictable.
# This updated strategy should provide a more balanced number generation, reflecting your desired priorities while minimizing bias. Feel free to test it out and adjust the weights or damping factors as needed!


# Key Features:
# 1- User Numbers: The user can choose to input their own numbers.
# 2- Multiple Tickets: The user specifies how many tickets they want to generate.
# 3- Custom Damping Factor: The user can provide a damping factor or use the default value of 0.8.
