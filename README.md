# Lotto Max Number Generator (Canada)

![Lotto Max Logo](./Lotto_Max_Logo.png)

This is a Python-based application for generating Lotto Max numbers using historical data and weighted combinations. The application allows users to generate multiple tickets with a balanced mix of frequently drawn numbers and randomly selected numbers, taking into account pairs, triplets, and other combinations.

## Features

- **Generate Multiple Tickets:** Users can generate multiple Lotto Max tickets at once.
- **Lucky Numbers:** Users can input their own lucky numbers, which will be included in the generated set.
- **Custom Damping Factor:** Users can adjust the damping factor to control the influence of the frequency table on the generated numbers.
- **Balanced Algorithm:** The algorithm takes into account the most common pairs, triplets, and other combinations while still introducing randomness.

## Installation

To run this application, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```

Follow the prompts to generate your Lotto Max tickets. You can choose the number of tickets to generate, input your lucky numbers, and specify a damping factor to influence the algorithm.

```
How many tickets would you like to generate? 3
Enter a damping factor (press Enter to use default 0.8): 0.7

Generating ticket 1:
Your Lotto Max Numbers: [3, 11, 23, 28, 31, 41, 46]

Generating ticket 2:
Your Lotto Max Numbers: [5, 10, 12, 19, 21, 33, 44]

Generating ticket 3:
Your Lotto Max Numbers: [2, 9, 14, 17, 25, 37, 45]
```

## Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm used in this project is designed to generate Lotto Max numbers with a balance between historical data and randomness:

- Frequency Table: Numbers are selected based on their frequency of occurrence in past draws. A damping factor controls the influence of these frequencies.
- Weighted Sets: The algorithm considers the most common pairs, triplets, and other combinations, giving them different weights in the selection process.
- Randomness: Despite the use of historical data, randomness is introduced to ensure that the generated numbers are not overly predictable.

## Damping Factor
The damping factor is a key parameter in the algorithm. It allows you to adjust how much influence the frequency table has on the generated numbers:

- Lower Damping Factor (e.g., 0.1): Increases the influence of the frequency table, making common numbers more likely to be selected.
- Higher Damping Factor (e.g., 0.8): Reduces the influence of the frequency table, allowing for more randomness.
